## Introduction

easyMap was constructed to allow small teams to quickly standup a basic web map with limited programming ability by allowing users to define everything they need from a single config file. 

By design, users should never have to modify a line of javascript to get a basic web map up and running. From the single config file, users should be able to:

- Display REST API endpoint data
- Toggle layers
- Click layers to view attribute data
- Grab current location

The program is also multi-instance, allowing you to host multiple map instances and projects on a single deployment and manage them all from the one config file.
