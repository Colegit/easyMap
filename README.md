## Introduction

This project was created to solve 3 core issues I have seen within GIS:

1) Geocortex and Esri products cost 15k or more yearly to run. For small municipalities or businesses, this is often not feasable. Especially when all thats really needed is a simple web map that can display GIS data and each object's attributes, with a few basic tools to navigate around.

2) Static Maps for descision support doesnt make sense in the modern age. Especially if the data you are working with is highly dynamic and in constant change.
   
3) For one-off field projects, setting up collector for ArcGIS, creating a user account, training the users, installing apps on their phones, it doesnt always make sense to go through this much effort if it is not a routine workflow. Add a new instance of easyMap, plug in their data's REST endpoints, give them the web URL to their custom tailored field map. 

## How it Works

- platform oriented architecture
- create multiple instances without much effort
